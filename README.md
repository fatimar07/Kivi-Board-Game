## 📚 About the Project
Kivi Board Game is a digital adaptation of the popular board game **Kivi**, developed as part of the **COMP 2005: Software Engineering** course at **Memorial University of Newfoundland**.

Working collaboratively with a team of four classmates, we transformed the board game into an interactive, Java-based application. Our project was recognized as the **best in class** and received a **perfect score**.

Due to course requirements, the source code cannot be shared publicly. However, a live executable version of the game along with code documentation is available.
